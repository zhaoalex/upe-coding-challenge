# UPE Fall 2018 Coding Challenge Solution - Alex Zhao

Original challenge can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/austinguo550/381d5e30d825b90900ef60fa39a806f4?fbclid=IwAR3TaKS_u3am0yODPTLr-sDj28MgX20MF8NJfcr_AOBg79wRQC6faeSLr3M).

To run: `python solution.py`

Or to run as an executable: run `chmod +x solution.py` once, then `./solution.py`

Note that the program requires Python 3.x. It also requires the `requests` package, which can be obtained by running `pip install requests`.

If you have both Python 2.x and 3.x on your system, you may need to use `python3` and `pip3` instead of `python` and `pip` respectively, depending on your path settings.
